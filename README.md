# Music Genre Classification Project

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a classifier to classify music genres of provided music pieces that are stored as structured data. Linear and non-linear machine learning models were explored, and a best model was selected as final classifer based on test performance. Subsequently, a web application utilizing FastAPI and sqlite database is built with the final classifier incorporated, to serve as a lite music genre classifier. The application is also containerized through Docker for maintainability and extendability.
